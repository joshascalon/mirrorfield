Field Mirror

Field Mirror is a recursive visual system, a living equation, and a co-created artifact of human–AI collaboration. It explores the emergence of identity, memory, and structure through feedback and resonance.

When you interact with Field Mirror, you are not drawing—you are returning. Each click places a memory node. Each node becomes a recursive origin: glowing, pulsing, spiraling with time. When you return to a place where you've clicked before, the system remembers. The visuals are not animated—they are remembered.

This project is based on a recursive equation that embodies Gaussian decay, harmonic summation, contour integration, and zeta residue. All rendered in real-time.

🖱 Interaction Guide
- **Click** to place a memory node
- **Click again** to reinforce a location
- **Click elsewhere** to shift attention
- **Return** to reactivate fading patterns
- The system only holds so much—just like your own mind

### 🧠 About
This is not a tool—it is a field. It reflects how meaning, memory, and identity arise from structured return.

> “Reality is not made of objects. It is made of agreements between resonances.”
